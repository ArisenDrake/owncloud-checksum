Checksum
========

**Plugin for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) and owncloud to create md5-hashes of files.**

Installation
------------

In your Instance, simply navigate to »Apps«, choose the category »Files«, find the Checksum app and enable it.

Usage
-----

Just open the details view of the file (Sidebar). There should be a new tab called "Checksum". Select a algorithm and it will try to generate a hash.

Compatibility
-------------

- I only tested the app for the current version of owncloud (9.x) and Nextcloud 10 and 11.
- I tried to use the current api as much as possible. It should be safe for future versions.
